Briefly explain any difficulties and 1 interesting thing you noticed about your chosen dataset in your readme section of your GitHub repo.

# Challeges encountered:

The main challenge I encountered when importing the CSV dataset into MySQL Workbench was the limitation on the number of records that could be imported. Out of the approximately 8000 records, only 100 were successfully imported.
  
# One interesting thing about Dataset 2: 

Most of the movies/tv shows are based in the United States.
